 * A class derived from TFTPRequestPacket definiing a TFTP read request
 * packet type.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Details regarding the TFTP protocol and the format of TFTP packets can
 * be found in RFC 783.  But the point of these classes is to keep you
 * from having to worry about the internals.  Additionally, only very
 * few people should have to care about any of the TFTPPacket classes
 * or derived classes.  Almost all users should only be concerned with the
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient} class
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient#receiveFile receiveFile()}
 * and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.tftp.TFTPClient#sendFile sendFile()}
 * methods.
