 * The TFTP class exposes a set of methods to allow you to deal with the TFTP
 * protocol directly, in case you want to write your own TFTP client or
 * server.  However, almost every user should only be concerend with
 * the {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#open  open() },
 * and {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#close  close() },
 * methods. Additionally,the a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.DatagramSocketClient#setDefaultTimeout setDefaultTimeout() }
 *  method may be of importance for performance tuning.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Details regarding the TFTP protocol and the format of TFTP packets can
 * be found in RFC 783.  But the point of these classes is to keep you
 * from having to worry about the internals.
