/***
 * RLoginClient is very similar to
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RCommandClient},
 * from which it is derived, and uses the rcmd() facility implemented
 * in RCommandClient to implement the functionality of the rlogin command that
 * first appeared in 4.2BSD Unix.  rlogin is a command used to login to
 * a remote machine from a trusted host, sometimes without issuing a
 * password.  The trust relationship is the same as described in
 * the documentation for
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RCommandClient}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * As with virtually all of the client classes in org.apache.commons.net, this
 * class derives from SocketClient.  But it relies on the connection
 * methods defined  in RcommandClient which ensure that the local Socket
 * will originate from an acceptable rshell port.  The way to use
 * RLoginClient is to first connect
 * to the server, call the {@link #rlogin  rlogin() } method,
 * and then
 * fetch the connection's input and output streams.
 * Interaction with the remote command is controlled entirely through the
 * I/O streams.  Once you have finished processing the streams, you should
 * invoke {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RExecClient#disconnect disconnect() }
 *  to clean up properly.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The standard output and standard error streams of the
 * remote process are transmitted over the same connection, readable
 * from the input stream returned by
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RExecClient#getInputStream getInputStream() }
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Unlike RExecClient and RCommandClient, it is
 * not possible to tell the rlogind daemon to return the standard error
 * stream over a separate connection.
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RExecClient#getErrorStream getErrorStream() }
 *  will always return null.
 * The standard input of the remote process can be written to through
 * the output stream returned by
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RExecClient#getOutputStream getOutputSream() }
 *
 * @see org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient
 * @see RExecClient
 * @see RCommandClient

     * the termination of the remote login shell after reaching end of file
     * on its standard output (accessible through
     * {@link #getInputStream  getInputStream() }.  Disconnecting
     * from the server or closing the process streams before reaching
     * end of file will terminate the remote login shell in most cases.
