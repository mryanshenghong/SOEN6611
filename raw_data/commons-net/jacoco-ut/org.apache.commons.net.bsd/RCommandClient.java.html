/***
 * RCommandClient is very similar to
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RExecClient},
 * from which it is derived, and implements the rcmd() facility that
 * first appeared in 4.2BSD Unix.  rcmd() is the facility used by the rsh
 * (rshell) and other commands to execute a command on another machine
 * from a trusted host without issuing a password.  The trust relationship
 * between two machines is established by the contents of a machine's
 * /etc/hosts.equiv file and a user's .rhosts file.  These files specify
 * from which hosts and accounts on those hosts rcmd() requests will be
 * accepted.  The only additional measure for establishing trust is that
 * all client connections must originate from a port between 512 and 1023.
 * Consequently, there is an upper limit to the number of rcmd connections
 * that can be running simultaneously.   The required ports are reserved
 * ports on Unix systems, and can only be bound by a
 * process running with root permissions (to accomplish this rsh, rlogin,
 * and related commands usualy have the suid bit set).  Therefore, on a
 * Unix system, you will only be able to successfully use the RCommandClient
 * class if the process runs as root.  However, there is no such restriction
 * on Windows95 and some other systems.  The security risks are obvious.
 * However, when carefully used, rcmd() can be very useful when used behind
 * a firewall.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * As with virtually all of the client classes in org.apache.commons.net, this
 * class derives from SocketClient.  But it overrides most of its connection
 * methods so that the local Socket will originate from an acceptable
 * rshell port.  The way to use RCommandClient is to first connect
 * to the server, call the {@link #rcommand  rcommand() } method,
 * and then
 * fetch the connection's input, output, and optionally error streams.
 * Interaction with the remote command is controlled entirely through the
 * I/O streams.  Once you have finished processing the streams, you should
 * invoke {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RExecClient#disconnect disconnect() }
 *  to clean up properly.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * By default the standard output and standard error streams of the
 * remote process are transmitted over the same connection, readable
 * from the input stream returned by
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RExecClient#getInputStream getInputStream() }
 * .  However, it is
 * possible to tell the rshd daemon to return the standard error
 * stream over a separate connection, readable from the input stream
 * returned by {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RExecClient#getErrorStream getErrorStream() }
 * .  You
 * can specify that a separate connection should be created for standard
 * error by setting the boolean &lt;code&gt; separateErrorStream &lt;/code&gt;
 * parameter of {@link #rcommand  rcommand() } to &lt;code&gt; true &lt;/code&gt;.
 * The standard input of the remote process can be written to through
 * the output stream returned by
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.bsd.RExecClient#getOutputStream getOutputStream() }
 * .
