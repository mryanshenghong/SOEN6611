/***
 * SMTP provides the basic the functionality necessary to implement your
 * own SMTP client.  To derive the full benefits of the SMTP class requires
 * some knowledge of the FTP protocol defined in RFC 821.  However, there
 * is no reason why you should have to use the SMTP class.  The
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTPClient} class,
 * derived from SMTP,
 * implements all the functionality required of an SMTP client.  The
 * SMTP class is made public to provide access to various SMTP constants
 * and to make it easier for adventurous programmers (or those with
 * special needs) to interact with the SMTP protocol and implement their
 * own clients.  A set of methods with names corresponding to the SMTP
 * command names are provided to facilitate this interaction.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * You should keep in mind that the SMTP server may choose to prematurely
 * close a connection for various reasons.  The SMTP class will detect a
 * premature SMTP server connection closing when it receives a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTPReply#SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE SMTPReply.SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE }
 *  response to a command.
 * When that occurs, the SMTP class method encountering that reply will throw
 * an {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTPConnectionClosedException}
 * .
 * &lt;code&gt;SMTPConectionClosedException&lt;/code&gt;
 * is a subclass of &lt;code&gt; IOException &lt;/code&gt; and therefore need not be
 * caught separately, but if you are going to catch it separately, its
 * catch block must appear before the more general &lt;code&gt; IOException &lt;/code&gt;
 * catch block.  When you encounter an
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTPConnectionClosedException}
 * , you must disconnect the connection with
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#disconnect  disconnect() }
 * to properly clean up the system resources used by SMTP.  Before
 * disconnecting, you may check the
 * last reply code and text with
 * {@link #getReplyCode  getReplyCode },
 * {@link #getReplyString  getReplyString },
 * and {@link #getReplyStrings  getReplyStrings}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Rather than list it separately for each method, we mention here that
 * every method communicating with the server and throwing an IOException
 * can also throw a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.MalformedServerReplyException}
 * , which is a subclass
 * of IOException.  A MalformedServerReplyException will be thrown when
 * the reply received from the server deviates enough from the protocol
 * specification that it cannot be interpreted in a useful manner despite
 * attempts to be as lenient as possible.
