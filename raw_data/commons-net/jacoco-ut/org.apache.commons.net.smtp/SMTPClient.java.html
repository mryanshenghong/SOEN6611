/***
 * SMTPClient encapsulates all the functionality necessary to send files
 * through an SMTP server.  This class takes care of all
 * low level details of interacting with an SMTP server and provides
 * a convenient higher level interface.  As with all classes derived
 * from {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient},
 * you must first connect to the server with
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#connect  connect }
 * before doing anything, and finally
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.SocketClient#disconnect  disconnect }
 * after you're completely finished interacting with the server.
 * Then you need to check the SMTP reply code to see if the connection
 * was successful.  For example:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *    try {
 *      int reply;
 *      client.connect(&quot;mail.foobar.com&quot;);
 *      System.out.print(client.getReplyString());
 *
 *      // After connection attempt, you should check the reply code to verify
 *      // success.
 *      reply = client.getReplyCode();
 *
 *      if(!SMTPReply.isPositiveCompletion(reply)) {
 *        client.disconnect();
 *        System.err.println(&quot;SMTP server refused connection.&quot;);
 *        System.exit(1);
 *      }
 *
 *      // Do useful stuff here.
 *      ...
 *    } catch(IOException e) {
 *      if(client.isConnected()) {
 *        try {
 *          client.disconnect();
 *        } catch(IOException f) {
 *          // do nothing
 *        }
 *      }
 *      System.err.println(&quot;Could not connect to server.&quot;);
 *      e.printStackTrace();
 *      System.exit(1);
 *    }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Immediately after connecting is the only real time you need to check the
 * reply code (because connect is of type void).  The convention for all the
 * SMTP command methods in SMTPClient is such that they either return a
 * boolean value or some other value.
 * The boolean methods return true on a successful completion reply from
 * the SMTP server and false on a reply resulting in an error condition or
 * failure.  The methods returning a value other than boolean return a value
 * containing the higher level data produced by the SMTP command, or null if a
 * reply resulted in an error condition or failure.  If you want to access
 * the exact SMTP reply code causing a success or failure, you must call
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTP#getReplyCode  getReplyCode } after
 * a success or failure.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * You should keep in mind that the SMTP server may choose to prematurely
 * close a connection for various reasons.  The SMTPClient class will detect a
 * premature SMTP server connection closing when it receives a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTPReply#SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE SMTPReply.SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE }
 *  response to a command.
 * When that occurs, the method encountering that reply will throw
 * an {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTPConnectionClosedException}
 * .
 * &lt;code&gt;SMTPConectionClosedException&lt;/code&gt;
 * is a subclass of &lt;code&gt; IOException &lt;/code&gt; and therefore need not be
 * caught separately, but if you are going to catch it separately, its
 * catch block must appear before the more general &lt;code&gt; IOException &lt;/code&gt;
 * catch block.  When you encounter an
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTPConnectionClosedException}
 * , you must disconnect the connection with
 * {@link #disconnect  disconnect() } to properly clean up the
 * system resources used by SMTPClient.  Before disconnecting, you may check
 * the last reply code and text with
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTP#getReplyCode  getReplyCode },
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTP#getReplyString  getReplyString },
 * and
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.smtp.SMTP#getReplyStrings getReplyStrings}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Rather than list it separately for each method, we mention here that
 * every method communicating with the server and throwing an IOException
 * can also throw a
 * {@link org.apache.commons.net.MalformedServerReplyException}
 * , which is a subclass
 * of IOException.  A MalformedServerReplyException will be thrown when
 * the reply received from the server deviates enough from the protocol
 * specification that it cannot be interpreted in a useful manner despite
 * attempts to be as lenient as possible.
